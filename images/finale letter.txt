Thanks for Playing. ðŸŒ¸

The game ends, but the memory stays,
A song, a story, a dance, a phrase.
Through every choice and every beat,
Youâ€™ve left your mark, both bitter and sweet.

A world of pixels, a world of rhyme,
We shared our moments, lost track of time.
The story bends, it twists, it fades,
But youâ€”youâ€”are the reason it was made.

You saw the smiles, you felt the pain,
You walked the path, you bore the strain.
In the end, itâ€™s all just a game,
But you'll never forget the name.

So thank you, dear player, for every try,
For every laugh, and every sigh.
The curtain falls, the lights go dim,
But in your heart, weâ€™ll live within.
